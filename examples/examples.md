# Examples for MkData

There are several examples in this folder, displaying possible ways to write and use mkdata generator files.

It is advised that you run the mkdata generator **in the examples folder**, since redirection files are relative to the present working directory.

These scripts are named as `*.gen`. The stdout of the generator is redirected to `*.stdout`, and stderr to `*.stderr` (manually).

Since randomness is built into the random module, you will get different results each time you run the generator.
